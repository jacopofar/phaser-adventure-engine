## A game
A better title will come later maybe.

This project defines an engine to run an adventure game in the browser, and implements a game with it.

The game and the engine are kept separated, the game is in the _game__ folder, the "engine", based on Phaser.js, is in the _src_ folder. By replacing the game folder with another one, you can run another game. This is to later allow game generation using external scripts, or a backend to deliver generated content.

## Run locally
Use `yarn install` and then `yarn run dev-serve` to run a local server that will compile and reload on change.

## Dependencies
You can look at [dependencies_reason.md](dependencies_reason.md) for an explanation about what and why is needed in the project.
